;;; Procedure:
;;;   factorial
;;; Parameters:
;;;   n, a positive integer
;;; Purpose:
;;;   Compute n!, the product of positive integers less than or
;;;   equal to a given positive integer.
;;; Produces:
;;;   product, an integer
;;; Preconditions:
;;;   n is a number, exact, an integer, and positive.
;;;   The product is not larger than the largest integer the
;;;     language permits.
;;; Postconditions:
;;;   product is the product of the positive integers less than or
;;;   equal to n.  That is,
;;;     product = 1 * 2 * ... * n

;;; Procedure:
;;;   count-from
;;; Parameters:
;;;   lower, an integer
;;;   upper, an integer
;;; Purpose:
;;;   Construct a list of the integers from lower to upper,
;;;   inclusive, in ascending order.
;;; Produces:
;;;   ls, a list
;;; Preconditions:
;;;   lower <= upper
;;;   Both lower and upper are numbers, exact, and integers.
;;; Postconditions:
;;;   The length of ls is 1 + upper - lower.
;;;   Every integer between lower and upper, inclusive, appears
;;;     in the list.
;;;   Every value in the list with a successor is smaller than its
;;;     successor.
;;;   For every integer k less than or equal to the length of
;;;       ls, the element in position k of ls is lower + k.

;;; Procedure:
;;;   termial
;;; Parameters:
;;;   number, a natural number
;;; Purpose:
;;;   Compute the sum of natural numbers not greater than a given
;;;   natural number
;;; Produces:
;;;   sum, a natural number
;;; Preconditions:
;;;   number is a number, exact, an integer, and non-negative.
;;;   The sum is not larger than the largest integer the language
;;;     permits.
;;; Postconditions:
;;;   sum is the sum of natural numbers not greater than number.
;;;   That is, sum = 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + number
